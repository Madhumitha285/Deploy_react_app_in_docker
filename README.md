# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#To run Docker and Deploying React App
Step 1: Install ubuntu

step 2: Install vscode : sudo dpkg -i code code_1.98.1-1718141439_amd64.deb

step 3 to install any package using supo apt install package name ex: sudo apt install nodejs

step 4 open vscode through ubuntu terminal

step 5 and in vscode install docker extension

step 6 Create a Docker file -> name it as DockerFile and start writing the instruction

step 7 For Docker Image go to official website -> if u go to  https://hub.docker.com/ 

step 8 Now we go to terminal tell our docker to package our application , we say docker build and we need to give our image a tag  

a tag to identify  

step 9 Docker build –t next specify the name ex: Docker build -t hello-docker .

step 10 to run the project in docker -> sudo docker run hello-docker 

step 11 in terminal add sudo docker images to see your image

step 12 to see all image you can use sudo docker ps a state

step 13 : to see only images which is in running state sudo docker ps

step 14: to run a container -> sudo docker run –it ubuntu to run a container
